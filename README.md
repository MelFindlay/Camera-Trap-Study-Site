# Camera-Trap-Study-Site
To accompany: Developing an empirical approach to optimal camera-trap deployment at mammal resting sites: evidence from a longitudinal study of an otter *Lutra lutra* holt, PAPER JUST SUBMITTED

This  paper analyses a 6 year camera-trapping datset of a holt in Scotland.

Four themes are presented in the paper (A to D). In this repository the R code and data frames are included for each theme and are prefixed with the appropriate letter:

A Disturbance: A_DISTURBANCE.R and A_DISTURBANCE.CSV 

B Number and Placement of Camera traps. B_NUMBER_PLACEMENT_CAMTRAPS.R and B_NUMBER_PLACEMENT_CAMTRAPS.CSV

C Study duration. C_STUDY_DURATION.R and two dataframes (1) C_STUDYDURATION_REST.CSV(containing records of "rests" of otter longer then 15 mins)
and (2) C_STUDYDURATION_PRESENCE.CSV (which contains all registrations of otter at the holt).

D Optimal camera trap settings. The first analysis looks at clip duration which assesses when a feature is first apparent in frame i.e. FAF. D_CLIP_DURATION.R and two csv files D_FAF_PRIM.csv (sex ID from primary characteristics) and D_FAFPRIMANDSEC.csv (sex ID using primary and secondary characteristics).

The second analysis in D investigates when otters were active to see if a duty time could be set with minimal loss of data. D_DUTYTIME.R to be used with D_DUTYTIME.csv
